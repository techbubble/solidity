# Ethereum Smart Contract Examples in Solidity

Various examples of Ethereum Smart Contracts that will help developers who are just getting started with Solidity. I use [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) and [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) for development, but these examples do not require either of them.
